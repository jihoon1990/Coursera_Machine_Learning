# Machine Learning

This repository is composed of a set of machine learning algorithms with application to real-world problems.

Most of the algorithm is based on the lecture "Machine Learning Specialization", provided by the University of Washington. 

This project is based on open-source packages such as, **`Numpy`, `Scipy`** and **`Scikit-learn`**, unlike original materials, which uses modeling tool as **Graphlab Create<sup>TM</sup>**.
