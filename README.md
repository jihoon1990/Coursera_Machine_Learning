# Machine Learning

Originally, I started this project for summarizing course contents and doing assignments with the well-documented template provided by the University of Washington. However, most of the original contents were heavily based on Turi’s packages such as ‘SFrame’ and ‘GraphLab Create’, which are neither open-source packages nor widely distributed. So I write and refactor all the contents to be implemented with open-source packages such as ‘Numpy’, ‘Scipy’, ‘Pandas’ and ‘Scikit-learn’.

Almost all topics are composed of two parts. It uses popular packages (mostly Scikit-learn) to describe algorithm and implements the algorithm from scratch without using packages or using as little as possible. Also, these algorithms are applied to real-world problems such as predicting house pricing, clustering news, identifying safe loans.
