Originally, I started this project for summarizing course contents and doing assignments with the well-documented template provided by the University of Washington. However, most of the original contents were heavily based on Turi’s packages such as `SFrame` and `GraphLab Create`, which are neither open-source packages nor widely distributed. So I write and refactor all the contents to be implemented with open-source packages such as `Numpy`, `Scipy`, `Pandas` and `Scikit-learn`.

Almost all of topics are composed of two parts. First, It implements algorithms with familiar packages (mostly Scikit-learn). And it implements the algorithm from scratch without using packages or using it as little as possible. Also, these algorithms are applied to real-world problems such as predicting house pricing, clustering news, identifying safe loans.
