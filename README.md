# Machine Learning

This project is based on the specialization course "Machine Learning", provided by the University of Washington with Coursera.

1. Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach
2. Machine Learning: Regression
3. Machine Learning: Classification
4. Machine Learning: Clustering & Retrieval

Original contents are heavily based on ‘Graphlab Create’, the modeling tool for machine learning developed as ‘turi’. I refactored all the contents to be implemented with open-source packages such as `Numpy`, `Scipy`, `Pandas` and `Scikit-learn`.
